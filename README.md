# Monte-Carlo-Localization
C++ implementation of Monte-Carlo localization and particle filter. Particles represent the posterior by a set of weighted samples. They can model arbitrary distributions and therefore are used when measurement or prediction distributions are non-Gausian. The localization can be summerized as follows:

 - __Particle Generation__: Particles are generated representing the robot with random pose uniformly distributed inside the map.
 - __Motion Update__: Particles are propogated based on the model of the system and motion model in case of localization
 - __Measurement Update__: Then they are weighted based on the likelihood of observations
 - __Resampling__: Resamplig ensures that particles stay in the meaningful areas of the state space. New particles are drawn from the set of particles with a probability proportional to the likelihood of their observations. In case of the example implementation The resampling of the particles is done in a way similar to _Stochastic universal sampling_ with equal spacing at 2 times the maximum weight of the particles. 


### Compiling the Program

#### Step 1
Install openCV:

- Windows: [See insructions here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html)

- Linux: [See instructions here](https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/)

 - Mac: You can use ```Homebrew```
```sh 
brew install opencv
```

#### Step 2
Clone the respository and build the ```cvplot``` package 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/farzingkh/Monte-Carlo-Localization.git
cd Monte-Carlo-Localization/cvplot
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
and then build and run the application.

on the main application directory:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./MCL
```
